# Survival_Analysis_Political_Leaders

This data set documents the party leadership succession in 23 parliamentary democracies(as defined by Lijphart 1999). There are 25 columns and 4559 rows in the data, it includes the country, party information, name, sex, and term information about the leaders, and it also includes a status vector which use one to indicate the leader is still in office and 0 to indicate that they are out of office. There are, however, many missing values in the data set due to the lack of information for some countries. In this project, we use tenure as the time variable which shows the leader’s time in office (in years), and status as our censoring data with 1 representing the leader’s still in office, 0 representing the leader has finished their term. The original paper studied the effect of succession on terms, in this project, however, we would like to find out if there’s any relationship between time and the length of tenure (for example, the more recent the election/ in office year is, the shorter the term is).(Horiuchi and Laing, 2015)
